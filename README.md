# Solidity Vault with ERC20 Token

This repository contains two Solidity smart contracts: `Vault.sol` and `ERC20.sol`. 

## Vault.sol

The `Vault.sol` contract implements a simple vault to deposit and withdraw ERC20 tokens. It interacts with an ERC20 token contract via an interface.

## ERC20.sol

The `ERC20.sol` contract is a basic implementation of an ERC20 token. It provides functionalities like transfer, approve, transferFrom, mint, and burn.
